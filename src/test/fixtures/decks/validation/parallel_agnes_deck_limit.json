  "description_md": "This deck focuses on supporting your team in almost all aspects (clueing, fighting, healing, etc.), making sure nobody on the team dies (including their Ally assets) while providing them a second chance to pass tests.\r\n<br><br>I've capped the XP to 22 so it's standalone-ready. (19 for standalone + 3 from [In the Thick of It](/card/08125)).  \r\n<br><br><b>How it Works: </b>: <br>\r\nPlay spells with reduced cost (Parallel Agnes' ability) and shuffle them back to the deck. After playing a spell, trigger the advanced [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018)'s reaction so you draw one card. Then, use your [Soothing Melody](/card/05314) to heal your lost health and sanity and to draw a card. This can trigger the Heirloom's reactive ability again. Rinse and repeat.\r\n<br><br><br><b> Strategy: </b> <br>\r\nYour primary goal is to find and play your [Hallowed Mirror](/card/54002) and your advanced [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018) as soon as you can as this is the bread and butter of this build. <br> <br>\r\nYou can do that by either trying to Mulligan for it, or by playing your [Backpack](/card/53011) as soon as you can. <br> <br>\r\nOnce it's done, the next objective is to thin out your deck until we reach the necessary amount of cards for the Recycle Engine.\r\n<br><br><br><b> Recycle Engine (Essentials) </b> <Br>\r\nIn the late game, your deck should ideally contain the following cards:\r\n<br><br>3 x [Soothing Melody](/card/05314) (Infinite Heal and Draw. This rivals both Carolyn and Vincent's healing capability.)<br>\r\n2 x [Spectral Razor](/card/10102) / [Read the Signs](/card/10101) (depending on what your team needs) <br>\r\n2 x [Ward of Protection  (2)](/card/03270) (Protect the team from nasty treacheries) <br>\r\n1 x [Time Warp](/card/03311) (\"Dormammu, I've come to bargain!\" It's always nice to see your teammate's reaction whenever you surprise them with this card.)<br> \r\n1 x [Hypnotic Gaze](/card/60423) (Taboo ver. is better since it can be any symbol, but the OG is still fine) <br>\r\n1 x [Deny Existence](/card/05032) (Protect yourself) <br>\r\n1 x [Counterspell](/card/04110) (Only if you're using the taboo version since it covers all symbols. The OG version is very limited.\r\n<br> <br>With your Recycle Engine in place, you'll only have to see your [nasty weakness](/card/01013) once and never have dead draws again.\r\n<br><br><br><b> Important Notes and Tips:</b> <br>\r\n1.) Ensure that your deck always has at least one card as it is not allowed to shuffle back a card to an empty deck. It is also not mandatory to trigger the advanced [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018)'s reaction.<br> <br>\r\n2.) When you use [Soothing Melody](/card/05314) on other investigators, they get healed but it is still you who gets to draw the card.<br> <br>\r\n3.) I suggest you  put the 2 traumas from [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) to health as you have higher HP and it can easily be healed by [Soothing Melody](/card/05314) and [Drain Essence](/card/10094).<br> <br>\r\n4.) Don't hesitate to use [David Renfield](/card/03112), you can easily kill him using Agnes' ability anyway. Just track the doom count.  <br> <br>\r\n5.) Feel free to swap your two upgraded [Spectral Razor](/card/06201) with two upgraded [Read the Signs](/card/06117) depending on your team's needs. You can have up to four copies of either card as it is allowed by Parallel Agnes' back.  <br> \r\n<br><br> <b> Situational Cards: </b><br>\r\n1.) [Alter Fate (1)](/card/04313) - For those scenarios with pesky attacment treacheries. Agnes doesn't need the Level 3 version as she can reduce the cost using her ability. <br> <br>\r\n2.)  [Four of Cups (1)](/card/05035) - Agnes already [fights](/card/06201) / [investigates](/card/06117) at 7. However, sometimes this is not enough for hard or expert difficulty so this can help boost your <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> <br> <br>\r\n3.) [Moonlight Ritual](/card/02267) - Has a nice combo with Cat Mask and [David Renfield](/card/03112). It's difficult to be consistent though especially if you don't have your Recycle Engine setup yet. <br> <Br>\r\n4.) [Blood Eclipse (3)](/card/04266) - The level 3 version lets you deal up to 5 damage at the cost of 5 HP. It's probably not the most optimal card, but it surely fits right into her Bad Blood theme. <br> <br>\r\n5.) [Deny Existence (5)](/card/05280) - Overpowered card for Parallel Agnes as you can probably imagine. Too bad it costs 5 exp though. I highly recommend getting this card if you're playing in a campaign or standalone with higher exp and have some luxury exp to spare.",
